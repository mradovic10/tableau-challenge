Module 18 Challenge

Two datasets were used for the purposes of this analysis: 2019 July-December data (‘combined_2019’) and 2022 July-December data (‘combined_2022’). This 6-month time frame was used because it concisely exemplifies warm, moderate, and cold temperatures in NYC. Furthermore, the years 2019 and 2022 were used because they offer the most recent available data that is not affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and all its repercussions (some might argue that 2022 data is still affected by it, but undoubtedly much less than data from 2020 and 2021). Once the datasets were cleaned, combined, and organized, the process of data exploration and analysis began.

In the first slide, ‘All NYC Stations and Popularity’, we can see all the available Citi Bike stations in the city and their popularities for both 2019 and 2022. The user is able to see the change in popularity by each month from July to December. Right from the start, we can see that there has been an overall expansion of stations, both into new territory and greater concentration in existing areas. The expansion into north Manhattan and the Bronx during this period is the most noticeable. As for the changes in popularity from month to month, that is analyzed further in the slide that follows.

‘Total Use by Month’ addresses the unusual phenomenon of monthly popularity. In 2019, total use of Citi Bikes did not fluctuate noticeably from the hot Summer to the cold Winter. People rode the bikes as much in July as they did in December. The Autumn months show similar numbers. In 2022, there was wilder fluctuation in bike use by month, but not in a way that we would expect. July was by far the most popular month; but, surprisingly, August was the least popular month. The two most popular months after July were November and December. The moderate Autumn months of September and October were somehow the least popular among the NYC crowd. One thing that we can see in ‘Total Use by Month’ that is not as surprising is that Citi Bike usage doubled from 2019 to 2022.

In the last slide, ‘Locations of Most and Least Popular Stations (2022)’, we see which stations are used most and which stations are neglected by riders. The top 50 stations are all located in Manhattan, on the southern half of the island. Given the population density of the borough, that is expected. The top 50 least popular stations are located on the outskirts of Citi Bike availability, but two zip codes in Brooklyn hold the majority of these: 11213 and 11233. Further research should be done to figure out why Citi Bikes are seldom used there and how we can entice their residents to ride the bikes.
